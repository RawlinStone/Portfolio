--Readme document for *author*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

10/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 2/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features

At least one image, with descriptive alt attribute(s)
Appropriate headings and paragraph text (for the most part)
Links to external page(s)
Multiple pages, with appropriate navigation between them

(b) CSS features

Modifying padding and margins to indent content and enhance readability
Modifying link, text color, or other colors to be visually appealing, perhaps with one of the pallette creators in the resources tab

(c) Advanced features
Creating a more complex page layout, such as including a sidebar or navigation bar
Embedded HTML5 media, like video or audio, with fallbacks
Leveraging nested selectors to specify format (I think I have this. I did find this one with help from W3 site though)

3. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
To study HTML: about 9 hours following the codeacademy guides (this includes breaks but it spanned across at least this many hours).
To study a bit of CSS: 1 hour
To complete the assignment itself: 3-4 hours
Total: About 14 hours


4. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs)
https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html
https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css
https://www.w3schools.com/
(I used many different pages on w3schools for reference)

5. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
A friend from my past, Jim, whom offered help if I needed any. 
He helped me clarify and point out a few of my obvious mistakes as well as helping me setup a VSCode environment so that
when I save my files it updates the website automatically using a local server extension. This was a lot easier than reloading
the html file repeatedly. 


6. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
Not that I am aware.
