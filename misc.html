        <p><span>When making this webpage, I discovered that band AC/DC is originally Australian.<br>
        I also learned that AC/DC (amongst many other artists) restricts embedding <br> 
        on youtube videos so I had to use a lyric video instead of the official.

		This is a video from one of my past classes where I had to make an AI for a tank game.<br>
		There is no audio I'm just using this small clip as a proof of concept.
