        Click the image above to be redirected to the itch.io page for my CGS capstone class.<br>
        My other projects I have worked on at UCI can be found <a href="https://rawlinstone.itch.io/" id="itch-page" class = "url" >here.</a><br>
        I am a Computer Game Science student at UCI. I transferred from San Bernardino Valley College in 2018. <br>

        
        It should open in a new window. Some browser extensions may cause the game not to work properly. <br>

        I made the background for this page. It is part of an art asset for the skybox in my capstone game. <br>
        I have primarily been the 2D and 3D asset designer for my capstone project, but I also participate <br>
        in game design discussions as well as program some features in the game. <br>
        Below are some pictures of my dogs whom I love very much.<br>
